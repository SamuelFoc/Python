# Python Core Concepts Repository

This repository contains Python code snippets that demonstrate how core concepts work, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), variables, data structures, and more. The examples are simple, well-documented, and designed to help you learn Python efficiently.

## Topics Covered:
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding how to declare variables and use basic data types like integers, strings, and booleans.
- **Control Flow**: Using `if`, `for`, `while`, and other control structures.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code, handling parameters, and understanding scope.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implementing classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Working with lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
- **Core Concepts**: Exception handling, file I/O, list comprehensions, and more.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Python scripts directly to explore the examples:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelFoc/Python.git
cd python-core-concepts
```
